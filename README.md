## A lil bit more the project:

### This fork is pretty much my personal take on Applio. ‚ú®
`Goal of this project is for me to have a much more flexible base than mainline rvc.`
<br/>
„Ö§
<br/>
**Features that are, at the time of writing, already added in:**
- Hold-Out type validation mechanism during training. ( L1 MEL, mrSTFT, PESQ, SI-SDR )  ` In between epochs. `
 
- BF16-AMP, TF32, FP32 Training modes available.  ` BF16 & TF32 require Ampere or newer GPUs. `
> NOTE: BF16 is used by default. If unsupported hardware detected, switched back to FP32. Inference is only in FP32.
 
- Support for 'Spin' ( Ain't sure of wavlm anymore).  ` Needs proper pretrains. `
 
- Ability to choose an optimizer.  ` ( Currently supporting: AdamW, RAdam, Ranger21 ) `
 
- Double-update strategy for Discriminator.
 
- Support for custom input-samples used during training for live-preview / live evaulation of model's performance.
 
- Mel spectrogram %-based similarity metric.
 
- Choice of using either Multi-scale mel loss or classic L1.
 
- Support for the following vocoders: HiFi-GAN, MRF-HiFi-gan and Refine-GAN.  ` ( And their respective pretrains. ) `
 
- Checkpointing and various speed / memory optimizations compared to RVC.
 
- New logging mechanism for losses: Average loss per epoch logged as the standard loss, <br/>and rolling average loss over 50 steps to evaluate general trends and the model's performance over time.
 
- Ability to quickly change the learning rate of Generator And Discriminator.
 
- Configurable lr warmup.
 
 
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 1: HiFi-gan is the stock rvc/applio vocoder, hence it's what you use for og pretrains and hifigan-based customs. ``
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 2: MRF-HiFi-GAN and Refine-GAN require new pretrained models. They can't be used with original rvc's G/D pretrains. ``
 <br/>
 
 
‚ú® to-do list ‚ú®
> - Ability to choose lr_decay from the ui.
 
üí° Ideas / concepts üí°
> - ~~Propably improving the mel-similarity.. or generally expanding the idea.~~ Irrelevant. Functionality taken over by hold-out validation mechanism.
> - and more.. perhaps ..

## Getting Started:

### 1. Installation of the Fork

Run the installation script:

- Double-click `run-install.bat`.

### 2. Running the Fork

Start Applio using:

- Double-click `run-fork.bat`.
 
This launches the Gradio interface in your default browser.

### 3. Optional: TensorBoard Monitoring

To monitor training or visualize data:
- Run the " run_tensorboard_in_model_folder.bat " file from logs folder and paste in there path to your model's folder </br>( containing 'eval' folder or tfevents file/s. )</br>If it doesn't work for you due to blocked port, open up CMD with admin rights and use this command:</br>`` netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 25565" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=25565 ``
